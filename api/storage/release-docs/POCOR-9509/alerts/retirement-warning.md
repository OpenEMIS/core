# Retirement Warning — `RetirementWarning`

> **Feature key:** `RetirementWarning` · **Process:** `AlertRetirementWarning`
> **Trigger:** Scheduled · **Recommended frequency:** `Monthly` (early window) + `Daily` (final window)

---

## What It Is

A reminder alert sent when a staff member's retirement date is approaching within a configured number of days. It gives HR officers and management the lead time they need to begin succession planning before the vacancy arises.

---

## Purpose

Succession planning in education requires advance action: advertising the post, recruiting and interviewing, completing paperwork, onboarding a replacement, and ensuring continuity of teaching or administration. Without advance warning, retirement dates can pass unnoticed until a vacancy appears unexpectedly — at which point it is too late to prevent disruption.

This alert provides a proactive, automated reminder at whatever lead time your deployment deems appropriate.

---

## When and How It Fires

This is a **scheduled** alert. The `alerts:check-and-queue` cron job runs on the configured frequency (daily, weekly, or monthly) and dispatches `alerts:retirement-warning` for every alert rule with feature `RetirementWarning` that is enabled.

The command queries all staff whose calculated or recorded retirement date falls within the next `threshold.value` days. Every eligible staff member generates a separate notification.

---

## Frequency

**Scheduled — `Monthly`, `Weekly`, or `Daily`** depending on how far in advance you want to alert.

A common practice is to configure **two rules** at different thresholds and frequencies:
- **90-day rule** with `Monthly` frequency → one reminder 3 months out
- **30-day rule** with `Daily` frequency → daily reminders in the final month

This avoids flooding recipients with daily reminders 90 days ahead while ensuring they are reminded regularly in the critical final window.

The scheduler deduplicates: if the command has already run today (same alert + checksum), it will not run again until the next period.

---

## Recipients

Security roles scoped to **the staff member's institution** — specifically the HR officers and administrators at that institution who are responsible for succession planning. A ministry-level HR role can also be included for system-wide oversight.

The institution scope ensures that a retirement at one school does not trigger notifications at all other schools.

---

## Threshold Configuration

The threshold is a JSON object with a single `value` field — the number of days before retirement within which the alert fires.

```json
{"value": 90}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `value` | Integer | Yes | Number of days before the retirement date |

### Examples

| Threshold | Frequency | Meaning |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| `{"value": 90}` | Monthly | Fire once when retirement is 90 days away |
| `{"value": 60}` | Weekly | Fire weekly when retirement is within 60 days |
| `{"value": 30}` | Daily | Fire daily when retirement is within 30 days |
| `{"value": 7}` | Daily | Final urgent reminder in the last week |

## Multiple Rules for One Alert

Configuring multiple rules for `RetirementWarning` is the recommended approach for most deployments:

- **Early-warning rule** (90 days, monthly) → broad notification for planning purposes, goes to HR and principal
- **Mid-term rule** (60 days, weekly) → prompt for active recruitment, adds district HR
- **Final-window rule** (30 days, daily) → urgent daily reminder with escalation instructions, widest audience
- **SMS rule** (7 days, daily) → last-resort SMS to principal if email has been ignored

This layered approach ensures no retirement date is missed at any planning stage.
