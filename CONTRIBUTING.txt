CONTRIBUTING TO OPENEMIS
========================

OpenEMIS was originally developed by UNESCO. OpenEMIS is a result of 
contributions from many people around the world including staff from ministries
of education, teachers, designers, developers, testers, translators and other 
stakeholders. 

You are very welcome to join us and contribute to the project. There are many 
ways you can help, not only with coding.

OpenEMIS is open to community code contributions, though all code must go
through design reviews, code reviews, manual testing, integration testing,
and automated testing.

Please contact support@openemis.org for further information on contributing to OpenEMIS.
